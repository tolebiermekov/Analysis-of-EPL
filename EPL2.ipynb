    "\n",
    "The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.

    "From **Figure 5.2.**, it is clear that one of the most strict referees are M Dean and R East with an average 4.44 and 4.4 yellow cards per game, respectively. However, O Langford is more liberal referee with an average 1 yellow cards per game. In addition, most of the referees showed in average 2 or more yellow cards per match."

    "Overall, I can make a some conclusion about English Premier League in 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, taking into account a coronavirus pandemic in season 2019/20, teams demonstrated similiar performance. Especially, teams like Manchester City and Liverpool showed great performance by standing out with high number of wins in both seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, most of the referees are not shy about showing cards. Which means most of them are in average show 2 or more yellow cards per match. Also, the strictest referee in EPL on yellow and red card is M Dean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, majority of teams had no problems with scoring goals at home compared to away matches. However, Manchester City and Liverpool showed great performance both on home and away matches by scoring in average nearly 2 or more goals per match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, almost all teams scored approximately 1 of 5 shots at home and away matches. Interestengly, percent realization of shots of Sheffield United is same as Manchester City's and Liverpool's. But, from previous investigation and graphs we are already know that Sheffield United did not have same great performance. Therefore, I can conclude that Sheffield United have only great realization of shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, usually bookmaker company does not believe in draw and away team's win as match outcome. Therefore, in average bookmaker favourite is home team."
